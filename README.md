[On Being A Senior Engineer](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)

I really found this article interesting as it gave me a view into the roles within the software development world and what really matters when in comes to having a long a prosperous career in the field.
The article pulls aside the notion of "how many years you've done something" or "how many languages or frameworks you know" and shifts it towards how one works with his peers, and how impact, responsibility, and growth are the keys to success.
The article provides a deep view on how seniority should be looked upon in the software development world. Especially in the sections where the ideas of mentorship are challenged with sponsorship. The ideas of training the necessary skills is not enough to make another succeed, but helping one become recognized and grow structurally matters a lot for both them and the structure of the overall organization.
